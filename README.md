# hspiceParser

Welcome to the hspiceParser Github page. hpsiceParser aims to be the final word in parsing hSpice output files, building on a long legacy of programs built by other circuit designers. The goals are (1) very simple installation, (2) support for a wide variety of output formats and (3) thorough documentation of what the parser is doing; if you've ever Googled "hSpice output format" and been frustrated at teh result, then we're hoping this project helps. 

In the spirity of 'very simple installation', you can download hspiceParser from [here](https://github.com/HMC-ACE/hspiceParser/blob/main/hspiceParser.py), or run the following terminal command:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HMC-ACE/hspiceParser/main/hspiceParser.py`

For assistance in using the parser, go to [Usage](Usage.md).

In the spirit of 'thorough documentation' we have included a description of the hSpice output file formats that we support (9601,2001 and ASCII) at [hSpice Output](hSpice_output.md)

We hope you download and use this parser, and we are also eager to integrate features from the community.  Send us some pull requests!
